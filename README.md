# Activity 1  
- Open Image and display its properties (place the image within the same directory or specify the path in your code)
- Open image
- Display the image using the different flags 
- Convert image to grayscale
- Get the image value of a pixel
- Convert the image to black and white
# Activity 2 Use any image. 
- Get the size of the image
- Get the value of a pixel in the image (R,G,B)
- Show the 4 different edges of an image (using different parameters/method). It could also be a method with 2 different attributes (threshold))
- Show the RGB colors of the same image separately (separate Green, Blue and Red images of the same image)
# Activity 3 Image Histogram: Make a program with the following specs:
- Show the original image 
- show the histogram of 2 different images
- Separate RGB histograms
- Display the histograms with the source image in one figure. 
 # Activity 4 Image properties: Make a program with the following specs:
- Select an image:
- display original image (colored)
- convert the image to grayscale 
- show the histogram of the grayscale image
- display the edges of the image 
- Display/plot all images in one figure only.
# Activity 5 
- Make a program that will display/plot all images in one figure only.
- Select an image:
	- original image (RGB)
	- display the edges of the image (use canny operator or algorithm)
	- display the grayscale of the image and its histogram
	- Print the properties of the image:
		1. filename
		2. format (ex: RGB)
		3. width
		4. height
		5. size
		6. get a value of a pixel in the image
